# Running
Please download the latest version of MotionView from [this link](https://github.com/lewispinstein-hue/MotionView/tree/main/Releases/Windows)
Double-click to install. If you are updating, it is best to uninstall before re-installing.

## Windows protected your PC message
This issue is because I am not a licensed Microsoft app vendor. This popup occurs because I am not a known publisher, so Microsoft blocks the app from starting without warning. 
If you just want to see the app, click "More Info" in the middle-left area of the popup, and then click "Run anyway." This will then open up the installer.

**Note:** This project is completely open-source, but you may still choose to not trust it.
